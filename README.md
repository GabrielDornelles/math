# Math
Implementing and visualizing what I learn through my Math classes.
# Linear Algebra
## Implemented:
- Dot product
- Cross Product 
- Mixed Product
- Angle between vectors
- Vectors module
- Contains p in line (if a point belongs to a line)
- 3d plot of 3 vectors (like 2 vectors and its cross product in the example, or any 3 vectors)
- Plan equation and 3d plot with its normal vector.

## Plan Equation defined by 3 points

TODO: Fix Auto Size for plan equation, it will look wrong when defining non infinite plans
